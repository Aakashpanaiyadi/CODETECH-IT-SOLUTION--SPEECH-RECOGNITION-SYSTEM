MENTOR : Neela Santhosh

Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a basic speech recognition system for controlling electronic devices using voice commands. An embedded board (such as Arduino, ESP32, or Raspberry Pi) will process spoken words and execute corresponding actions, such as turning an LED on/off or controlling a motor.

Key Elements of the Project
1. Speech Recognition Module
Recognizes predefined voice commands.
Modules like Elechouse V3 (offline) or Google Speech-to-Text API (online) can be used.
2. Microcontroller/Embedded Board
ESP32, Arduino Uno, or Raspberry Pi can process voice inputs and control devices.
The board receives speech input, processes it, and triggers actions.
3. Input Device (Microphone/Speech Module)
A microphone (connected to a speech module or embedded board) captures voice commands.
For offline recognition, a dedicated speech module (e.g., Elechouse V3, EasyVR) can be used.
4. Output Devices (Controlled Devices)
LEDs, motors, relays, or other actuators respond to voice commands.
Example: Saying “Turn on light” switches an LED on.
5. Power Supply
5V or 3.3V supply for the microcontroller and connected peripherals.
Technology Used
1. Embedded Systems
Uses Arduino, ESP32, or Raspberry Pi to interface with sensors and actuators.
2. Speech Recognition Algorithms
Offline: Uses pre-trained voice recognition modules (e.g., Elechouse V3).
Online: Uses Google Speech API (for Raspberry Pi or ESP32 with WiFi).
3. Signal Processing & Machine Learning (Optional)
Advanced systems can use TensorFlow Lite or Edge Impulse to recognize custom voice patterns.
4. Wireless Communication (Optional)
Bluetooth (HC-05, ESP32) or Wi-Fi (ESP8266, ESP32) for remote voice control.
